# FO4SaveCleaner
I tend to save a lot in Fallout 4. Having lots of saves reeeaaaally starts to slow the game down when trying to save/load. This gets rid of old saves you no longer need/want.

It should *just* work TM.

By that, download, put it wherever you desire. Run it. It may take a few seconds to start (depending on how many saves you have).

Once it pops up, check if you want to make backups first, enter the number of saves you want to preserve per character, and then hit Clean!
It will let you know when it's finished (fairly quick).

Yay faster Fallout 4.

Notes:  
Backing up simply moves the unneeded saves to a "Backups" folder in "..My Documents/My Games/Fallout4". Gets the benefit of Fallout 4 not chugging on them, but does not free space.
